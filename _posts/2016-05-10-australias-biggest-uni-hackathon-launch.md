**MELBOURNE, Australia** – Calling all university and TAFE students! UNIHACK, Australia's premier student hackathon, is coming back on July 30. Registrations are now officially open for teams who think they have what it takes to impress the judges and be crowned UNIHACK champions for 2016.

UNIHACK 2016, sponsored by Bosch, will begin on Saturday July 30 from 12pm at LAB-14, part of the Carlton Connect Initiative in Melbourne.

Teams have 24 hours to produce a working prototype of their idea. That idea can be anything: a website, a mobile app, game, or even a working hardware hack. The most important thing is that the product works when presented to the judging panel, comprising of some of Australia's leading developers, designers and startup thinkers.

The winning team will receive $4000 in cash. Teams that place second and third will receive $2000 and $1000 respectively. The full list of prizes on offer at UNIHACK this year will be announced closer to the commencement date.

Whether you are an avid programmer or a first-time hacker, UNIHACK welcomes everyone, regardless of skill level. You will have the opportunity to build, collaborate and learn from your fellow hackers and mentors at the event. The event will also have a number of tech talks throughout to help participants learn new or extend their existing skills.

UNIHACK is organised by WIRED Monash, the IT student society at Monash University Clayton.

### The Imagination Hackathon

UNIHACK, unlike most hackathons in Australia, does not have a theme. Instead, teams are asked to tap into their brains and think creatively. This freedom to imagine means they don’t have to worry about five-year business plans, and allows them to focus solely on the idea.

Last year's competition saw a wide variety of ideas being built - from self-destructing documents; real-time social media sentiment trackers; to an app that solves puzzles after taking a picture. We even had a game that mixes internet comments with ‘meme culture’ to see who can argue for or against a topic they would not necessarily support.

**Terence Huynh, founder of UNIHACK Melbourne, said:**

> "We want UNIHACK to help create a new generation of designers, developers and entrepreneurs - all thinking of new, imaginative and creative ideas to improve our lives, and disrupt the industries of today. From the outside, these ideas may seem like fun little hacks. However, when you apply these techniques to different industries, you can see their great potential.
>
> Last year's cohort set the bar really high. I cannot wait to see what this year's competitors come up with during the 24 hours they have to build."

### Supporting Australian Innovation

UNIHACK is proud to announce that Bosch, one of the world's leading engineering and electronics manufacturers, will become this year's Platinum sponsor.

**Gavin Smith, Regional President with responsibility for Oceania from Bosch Australia, said:**

>“The Bosch Group is a leading global supplier of technology and services. The basis for the company’s future growth is its innovative strength and creating technology for a connected life.
>
> Our history is in the automotive industry however we work in fields as diverse as the Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0 and intelligent agriculture.
>
> We see UNIHACK as a great opportunity to get involved with the future generation of product developers and those who share our mentality for innovation and disruption in Australia.”

Other companies that have signed on to sponsor UNIHACK 2016 include IMC Pacific, Odecee, Telstra, ThoughtWorks, Adobe, Atlassian, Deloitte, IRESS, PwC, Seamless CMS, Future Assembly, Namecheap, Outware Mobile, Readify, Sphero and Uber.

In addition, the event is supported by two of Australia's largest universities: Monash University and the University of Melbourne; and the Wade Institute for Entrepreneurship.

**Hugo Müller-Downing, president of WIRED Monash, said:**

>"This year's UNIHACK promises to be even bigger and better than last year's event, and we could not have done it without the continuing support from the IT industry in Melbourne. On behalf of the club, we would like to thank all of our sponsors and partners - especially Bosch, the University of Melbourne, and Monash University - for making it possible to run such a big event."
