**MELBOURNE, Australia** â€” UNIHACK, Australia's premier student hackathon, has
revealed the judges who will decide this year's winner; and for the first time,
women make up more than 50 percent of the panel.

The UNIHACK judging panel comprises of seven industry professionals: six of whom
are selected by the UNIHACK Organising Committee and one selected by Bosch, this
year's platinum sponsor.

The panel will decide the winner using the following criteria:

* originality;
* technical difficulty;
* polish and design; and
* usefulness

This year's judges are:

* Ren Butler, Startup Market Manager at BlueChilli
* Jason Cormier, API Evangelist at TIBCO Mashery
* Jo Cranford, Engineering Manager at Culture Amp
* Atlanta Daniel, General Partner at Signal Ventures
* Remya Ramesh, Experience Design Lead at Seamless CMS
* Bernard Schokman, Head of UX & Innovation at Foxley and UX Business Consultant

The Bosch-appointed representative will be announced at a later date.

**Terence Huynh, the founder of UNIHACK Melbourne:**

> "We are ecstatic to have some of Australia's highly-respected designers,
>developers and members of the startup community as our judges for this year's
>competition. Just like us, they cannot wait to see what our student competitors
>can come up with in 24 hours."
>
> "UNIHACK is committed to increasing the diversity of participants and support
>traditionally underrepresented groups in IT, especially women. Our judging panel
>reflects our support and push towards gender diversity."

**Sophia Huynh, Vice President of WIRED Monash:**

>"We looked at the tech community around us and picked those we felt were best
>suited for the role. The selection was made based on three categories -
>ideation, technical and design - so that we could achieve the best balance on
>the judging panel. All we have left to find is a robot and cupcake."
